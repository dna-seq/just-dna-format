# Changelog

Shared change log for the just-dna module format/compiler ecosystem. Because
`just-dna-format` + `just-dna-compiler` are consumed by **just-dna-pipelines**,
**just-dna-marketplace**, and **just-dna-agents**, cross-repo integration changes are recorded
here so parallel work in the other repos isn't surprised. Newest first.

## 2026-07-06 — just-dna-pipelines repointed at the published libs

Consumer-side integration in `just-dna-lite/just-dna-pipelines`. No changes to the published
`just-dna-format` / `just-dna-compiler` packages themselves; this entry documents how a consumer
adopted them and the contract facts that surfaced.

### Added
- `just-dna-pipelines` now depends on `just-dna-format>=0.1.0` and `just-dna-compiler>=0.1.0`
  (`uv add`).
- `.json` added to `module_registry._SPEC_SUFFIXES`, so a compiled `manifest.json` is copied
  alongside the parquets on register/install (was previously dropped).

### Changed
- `just_dna_pipelines.module_compiler` is now a **compatibility shim layer** over the libs; the
  duplicated in-repo schema + transform were deleted:
  - `module_compiler/models.py` → re-exports `just_dna_format.spec` (DSL models + constants) and
    `just_dna_compiler.models` (`ValidationResult`, `CompilationResult`).
  - `module_compiler/compiler.py` → re-exports `validate_spec` / `compile_module` /
    `reverse_module` from `just_dna_compiler.compiler`.
  - `module_compiler/resolver.py` → keeps the pipelines-only `ensure_resolver_db` provisioning and
    a `resolve_variants` wrapper that provisions then delegates to `just_dna_compiler.resolver`.
  - `module_compiler/__init__.py`, `cli.py` unchanged in surface (names still resolve via shims).
- Kept pipelines tests were adapted to the libs' current `validate_spec` stats keys — see
  Contract notes below. Test **coverage** is unchanged; only expected key names changed.
- CLI `pipelines module compile` help text updated: it no longer claims to auto-download the
  Ensembl cache from HuggingFace (the lib is inject-only).

### Behavior change (downstream)
- Ensembl resolution is now **inject-only at the library boundary**: `just_dna_compiler` never
  downloads a reference. Provisioning stays in just-dna-pipelines:
  - `register_custom_module` **auto-provisions** — when `resolve_with_ensembl` is on and no cache
    is passed, it calls `ensure_resolver_db()` (idempotent: cheap when the cache exists, builds/
    downloads from HuggingFace only when absent) and injects the result. Failure degrades to
    inject-only (resolution skipped with a warning). This preserves the pre-extraction convenience.
  - Direct callers of `just_dna_pipelines.module_compiler.resolver.resolve_variants` also
    auto-provision via `ensure_resolver_db`.
  - `compile_module` itself (the library re-export) remains inject-only: called directly with no
    cache and none present, it skips resolution with a warning rather than downloading. The
    `pipelines module compile` CLI relies on an already-provisioned cache (help text updated).
  - Integration tests pass because their `ensembl_db_path` fixture provisions the default cache
    the lib then reads.

### Contract notes for other consumers (-marketplace, -agents)
- **`ValidationResult.stats` keys renamed** vs. the pre-extraction schema:
  `unique_genes → gene_count`, `study_rows → study_count`, `unique_variants → variant_count`;
  `genes` / `categories` are sorted lists with `None` filtered out. `unique_rsids` and
  `module_name` are unchanged.
- **`VALID_PRIORITIES` and `PMID_PATTERN` are not in `just_dna_format.spec`** — they were dead code
  in the original schema (no validator referenced them / the PMID validator was commented out). The
  live study rule remains "pmid must be non-empty". See ROADMAP.md → Observations.
